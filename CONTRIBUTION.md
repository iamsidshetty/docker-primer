## Contributing to the Repository

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/iamsidshetty/docker-primer) on GitHub.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/iamsidshetty/docker-primer).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/docker-primer.git
        $ cd docker-primer

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. Don't work in the `master` branch!

        $ git checkout -b my-changes-branch

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add all_modified_files
        $ git commit -m "short description of the changes made"

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-changes-branch

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `docker-primer` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.
